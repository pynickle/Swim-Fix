# Swim Fix

An Architectury mod that fixes Minecraft bug [MC-220390](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-220390) for swimming in water.

## About The Bug (From Minecraft Bug Tracker)

If you hit an entity while swimming underwater, the player will stop swimming for a brief moment (it changes the size of its hitbox and returns to the swimming one) and then get stuck in the middle of the water if they try to swim below a block (the player gets stuck when their large hitbox collides with a block, even if they are using a different size hitbox).
